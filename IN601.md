# Professional Practice 2

This semester I have held the role of team co-ordinator in the Red Team.
It has been a fun yet challenging position; communicating, managing and working with my team, and I have really valued the experience.

In this portfolio I have compiled sections on my personal contributions during team assignments, along with progress towards my goals.

### Assignment One: Flyer

During the first assignment I faced difficulty distributing the limited workload evenly throughout the team.

The planning of the document started with brainstorming session to collect content and layout ideas.

Here I have included some early ideas

Once we had some loose concepts Cameron was tasked with refining our drafts and creating a physical draft to work from, while Tim and Rory were tasked with writing content for the flyer. 
Once the team had completed their drafts I took their work and finished building the flyer in Adobe photshop.

After we had a finished draft I sat down with Tim to proofread and edit the document, while Cameron and Rory reviewed the design, and once we were satisfied I submitted the final draft.

### Assignment Two: Website

### Assignment Three: Proposal
