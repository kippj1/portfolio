# Professional Practice 2

This semester I have held the role of team co-ordinator in the Red Team.
It has been a fun yet challenging position; communicating, managing and working with my team, and I have really valued the experience.

In this portfolio I have compiled sections on my personal contributions during team assignments, along with progress towards my goals.

### Assignment One: Flyer

The planning of the document started with brainstorming session to collect content and layout ideas.

Here I have included some early ideas:

Once we had some loose concepts Cameron was tasked with refining our drafts and creating a physical draft to work from, while Tim and Rory were tasked with writing content for the flyer. 

When the team had completed their drafts I took their work and used it to build the flyer in Adobe photshop.

After we had a finished draft I sat down with Tim to proofread and edit the document, while Cameron and Rory reviewed the design, and once we were satisfied I submitted the final draft.

### Assignment Two: Website

My initial task as part of the website build was to find a suitable development environment and hosting option. 

Our initial plan was to use wordpress.org backed by git, although this fell through as it wasn't feasible to re-configure the local environment every work session, so we migrated to a gitpages solution working out of the bitPro repository.

While we were having technical difficulties with development, the teams continued production elsewhere by nominating members from each group to compile a bitPro brand style guide to ensure uniform design throughout the site. Cameron voluteered to be our style representative and I feel he has done well.

As we approached the term break team communication and attendance became fairly spotty making it difficult to difficult to delegate tasks and co-ordinate assignments. In hindsight I should have been more proactive in pressing on with the build, instead of waiting to plan our build as a whole team. 

Cameron and I sat down together to hash out a website structure:

and some page designs:

Once we had our design documents I paired Cameron up with Patrick from Blue team, as Patrick was working on the live site and had a lot of good experience to share with Cameron as he started to work on our section of the site.
Meanwhile I caught Tim and Rory up to speed on the build and tasked them with generating content for the current users on our site.

As we approached the deadline with this assignment I spent most of my time proofreading and editing our site content and troubleshooting build problems with Cameron.

As it stands we still have issues to fix in our build.

### Assignment Three: Proposal

Our final assignment has been a GigCity funding proposal for the DCC.

We spent a long time planning and re-designing our approach as we had difficulty finding information related to the project, our intended client and audience, and their supporting parties. Due this ambiguity I took a step back from the proposal and decided it would be best to start "from the ground up". We split up our research topics to learn as much as we could about the existing migrant/ex-refugee community in Dunedin and how best we could develop solutions to problems we would face in their shoes.

After this initial research we compiled a few rough drafts on the direction we wanted to take our proposal:

along with some questions and proposed solutions we could bring to our client:

The feedback we received from the client was invaluable in shaping our solution, and introduced new concerns we had not even considered. I set my team out on new research topics regarding physical space and transportation around Dunedin, and popular web design examples to emulate in our proposal, while I focused my research on mobile App examples to incorporate into our proposal.

Once the team reconvened with new information, we compiled our reports into a final draft and submitted that for grading.

This has been a very stressful project to manage regarding the workload and deadline, and I am proud of my team and the proposal we have produced.
