# Professional Practice 2

This semester I have held the role of team co-ordinator in the Red Team.
It has been a fun yet challenging position; communicating, managing and working with my team, and I have really valued the experience.

In this portfolio I have compiled sections on my personal contributions during team assignments, along with progress towards my goals.

### Assignment One: Flyer

The planning of the document started with brainstorming session to collect content and layout ideas.

Here I have included some early ideas:

Once we had some loose concepts Cameron was tasked with refining our drafts and creating a physical draft to work from, while Tim and Rory were tasked with writing content for the flyer. 

When the team had completed their drafts I took their work and used it to build the flyer in Adobe photshop.

After we had a finished draft I sat down with Tim to proofread and edit the document, while Cameron and Rory reviewed the design, and once we were satisfied I submitted the final draft.

### Assignment Two: Website

My initial task as part of the website build was to find a suitable development environment and hosting option. 

Our initial plan was to use wordpress.org backed by git, although this fell through as it wasn't feasible to re-configure the local environment every work session, so we migrated to a gitpages solution working out of the bitPro repository.

As we approached the term break team communication and attendance became fairly spotty making it difficult to difficult to delegate tasks and co-ordinate assignments. In hindsight I should have been more proactive in pressing on with the build, instead of waiting to plan our build as a whole team. 

Cameron and I sat down together to hash out a website structure:

and some page designs:

Once we had our design documents I paired Cameron up with Patrick from Blue team, as Patrick was working on the live site and had a lot of good experience to share with Cameron as he started to work on our section of the site. Meanwhile I caught Tim and Rory up to speed on the build and assigned them the task of generating content for current users on the site.

### Assignment Three: Proposal
