# IN602 Software Engineering

## My Story

This semester in Software Engineering we have designed, built and deployed a web app for the Meals on Wheels programme run by the St. Barnabus Trust. I really didn't know what to expect from this project, as I held little tangible experience in building a software solution not only for a live client, but also within a large project team. The build started out fairly trivial, but as more information continued to roll in from our client, the list of requirements for our build continued to grow. The size and complexity of the project began to take off, and the class divided into teams to tackle each aspect of development.

I volunteered to be part of the server team, feeling this was the best fit for me as I continue to develop my interest in networking and virtualization. I started out by learning some basic node.js as directed by Adon, and learned a cool new way to build and host a web app. 
The server engine we built was then used for testing by the web team, however this was painful and inefficient to due Polytech securtity policies deep freezing our development envionment at the end of every day. This led us to look for ways we could export our dev environment, and we began to explore cloud services.

I opened a frankenstein-esque Amazon Web Services account using a combination of project-centric names, my personal phone number, and Adon's financial information to find an environment to host our app. I used an Amazon VM running Ubuntu 14.04 to start the build, built some networking rules for the machine, generated and exported an SSH private key, and connected to the machine ready to start deployment.
I worked with members from the class to compile a list of dependencies required to run our app, and included these in a startup script to be run upon deployment. With a git connection to our project repo, keeping the app up to date and testing became much more simple than it had previously been.

As the semester was coming to its end, our deadline was approaching. Each team began to finalize their work and merge their respective development branches. This barrage of contributions brought with it a number of deployment problems. New frameworks had been implemented, introducing new dependencies, leaving outdated dependencies to be removed to mitigate further, inevitable conflicts. Keeping the site operational became a full time job as I spent most of my time during the closing weeks of semester troubleshooting new problems and googling error codes instead of studying for my exams. 

Oddly enough I feel as though this mad dash may have worked out in my favour. It seems the best way I could have prepared for my final software engineering exam came in the form of practicing "googling stuff" and understanding those same error logs that were causing me so much grief. Adon's fresh take on exam season provided me an odd sense of relief. With no set exam topic other than "Software Engineering" the exam boiled down to something of a sink or swim moment on the day, and I feel if I hadn't been getting my ass kicked by error codes for numerous hours prior, I might not have held the tempered/broken will to even sit through the entire thing.
